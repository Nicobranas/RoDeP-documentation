## Preparing your components

<p align = justify>Before assembling the RoDeP, be sure having all the required components, they are enumerated in the </p>[component list](component.md).


## 1. Assembling the frame
<p align = justify> In order to assemble the frame, you have to gather the following elements :
<br/> </p>


|Number|Component|
|---|---|
|1|frame|
|2|wheel|
|2|wheel motor|
|2|roulette|
|2|battery wedge|

<p align = justify> In the end, you should have something like this :

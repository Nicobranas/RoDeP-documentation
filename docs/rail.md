# Rail DIN system

<p align = justify>A Rail DIN is a standardized support profile, generally metallic, widely used for the mechanical support of electrical equipment. 
The Rail DIN system allows us to assemble and disassemble easily the differents electronical components. Moreover, it offers us the possibility of changing the components whithout having to modify the frame.</p>

## Rail DIN support and adaptator

<p align = justify>To fix the different processors and controller on the Rail DIN we use support, they allow a strong fixation avoiding all parasitic movement.</p>

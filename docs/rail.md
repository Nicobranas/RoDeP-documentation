# Rail DIN system

<p align = justify>A Rail DIN is a standardized support profile, generally metallic, widely used for the mechanical support of electrical equipment.
The Rail DIN system allows us to assemble and disassemble easily the differents electronical components. Moreover, it offers us the possibility of changing the components whithout having to modify the frame.</p>

## Rail DIN support and adaptator

<p align = justify>To fix the different processors and controller on the Rail DIN we use support, they allow a strong fixation avoiding all parasitic movement.</p>

<p align = justify>Then we use homemade plastic adaptator to bind devices and supports. We have choosen to use 2.5mm insert and M2.5 screws 6mm in length as fasteners.
The assembly between the card, the adapter and the support is rather simple </p>

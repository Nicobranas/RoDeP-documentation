# About the RoDeP project

<p align = justify> The RoDeP (standing for "RObot DEplaceur de Plantes" in French, which can be translated by PMORO ("Plant MOver RObot")) project is a collaboration between Sony CSL Paris and Polytech Sorbonne, a graduating school of engineering, locatedd in Paris. It has be given to students of Polytech Sorbonne in the Robotic specialty, as their industrial project, realised in cooperation with this company. <br/>
Sony CSL Paris developped a plant scanner, which makes 3D model of vegetable, in order to track their growth. Putting plants, waiting for the scan to complete and then taking the plant out of the scanner is a repetitive and not funny task, that's why we developped a robot to assist the user of the scanner in his task. The first version of the robot is working, and has been tested.

The second team, composed by David COLLIAUX and Peter HANAPPE, is representing Sony CSL. Both of them works in the Sustainability department, which is "commited to build tools for a sustainable society and raise awareness about the challenges of our era". They helped the students in all kind of situation, and we thank them a lot for it.<br/><br/>

Last but not least, the Polytech Sorbonne team, with Pierre CARLES, supervised the students while they were at the school, on the technical side of the project. His support managed to drive us through the project, and we owe him a lot on the line following process.

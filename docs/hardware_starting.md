# Building the robot

## Building order

<p align = justify>The RoDeP build can be separate in 2 parts : the frame and the gripper. The first one has most of the electronics, with the battery and the boards, the second has the gripping system, used for the elevation of the plant. Therefore, both part can be assembled simulteanously, and bind together at a later point of the project.<br/> </p>

## Building the frame

<p align = justify>As previously mentionned, the frame has most of the electronics systems of the robot. You can find the instructions in the next part.

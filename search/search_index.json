It has be given to students of Polytech Sorbonne in the Robotic specialty, as their indusrial project, realised in cooperation with this company. Sony CSL Paris developped a plant scanner, which makes 3D model of vegetable, in order to track their growth. Project funding \u00b6 The project has been funded by Sony CSL entirely. Work team \u00b6 3 teams participated in this project. The first is the student team, including Nicolas BRANAS, Paul CHAMBROUX, Alexandre LEU and Hugo PASQUIER. It has been developped over the course of their 4th year in Polytech Sorbonne. The second team, composed by David COLLIAUX and Peter HANAPPE, is representing Sony CSL. Both of them works in the Sustainability department, which is \"commited to build tools for a sustainable society and raise awareness about the challenges of our era\". Last but not least, the Polytech Sorbonne team, with Pierre CARLES and Tarik LARJA onboard, supervised the students while they were at the school, both on the technical and the management side of the project.
